When eight-year-old Kathy Stone turns up on the side of the road a year after her abduction, the world awaits her harrowing story. But Kathy doesn't say a word. Traumatized by her ordeal, she doesn't speak at all, not even to her own parents.

Child therapist Robin Hart is the only one who's had success connecting with the girl. Robin has been using play therapy to help Kathy process her memories. But as their work continues, Kathy's playtime takes a grim turn: a doll stabs another doll, a tiny figurine is chained to a plastic toy couch. All of these horrifying moments, enacted within a Victorian doll house. Every session, another toy dies.

But the most disturbing detail? Kathy seems to be playacting real unsolved murders.

Soon Robin wonders if Kathy not only holds the key to the murders of the past but if she knows something about the murders of the future. Can Robin unlock the secrets in Kathy's brain and stop a serial killer before he strikes again? Or is Robin's work with Kathy putting her in the killer's sights?","""This was almost an Amazon First Read's pick for me but I grabbed a different one instead.

I actually had to stay up to the wee hours of the morning to finish it and find out the who what where and why of the abduction. A great read, perhaps because it didn't follow the standard tropes of its genre and consequently surprises the reader as they get drawn in ever deeper to the characters and the story itself.

Every day I clean the Winchesters' beautiful house top to bottom. I collect their daughter from school. And I cook a delicious meal for the whole family before heading up to eat alone in my tiny room on the top floor.

I try to ignore how Nina makes a mess just to watch me clean it up. How she tells strange lies about her own daughter. And how her husband Andrew seems more broken every day.

I only try on one of Nina's pristine white dresses once. Just to see what it's like. But she soon finds out… and by the time I realize my attic bedroom door only locks from the outside, it's far too late.

Barrington University is home of the Lords, a secret society that requires their blood in payment. They are above all—the most powerful men in the world. They devote their lives to violence in exchange for power. And during their senior year, they are offered a chosen one.

I VOW. YOU VOW. WE VOW.

People think growing up with money is freeing, but I promise you, it's not. My entire life has been planned out for me. I never got the chance to do what I wanted until Ryat Alexander Archer came along and gave me an option for a better life. He offered me what no one else ever had—freedom.

I chose to be his. He made me believe that anyway, but it was just another lie. A way that the Lords manipulate you into doing what they want.

Yes the steam and sex was great, and right on par for anyone who loves darker kinks, but the drama and the story was so intriguing. For some readers, I can understand it might be triggering.

I loved the dark mafia hitmen vibes. It was dark without being too brutal. Don't get me wrong, there were some WTF scenes, but it was still never over the limit. Read the trigger warnings.

The characters all have such a personality! I loved their interactions and dynamics. Both Ryat and Blake were so independent and they truly grew and changed over the course of the book. I loved that they weren't boring.

The one thing I could not get on board with in this book, though, Is that they kept saying song titles/ artists. TBH, I don't care. Give me a playlist at the beginning of the music is so important. Every time one came up I wanted to groan in frustration. Other than that, minus a few kind of noticeable spelling errors/ missing words, this book was a satisfying read."" --Caroline (Amazon Reader)",4.0,"""I finished it.

This book was written to help you go beyond your thinking and discover the truth of what you already intuitively know deep inside your soul.","""I enjoyed this quick-read. It was more of an intro to a zen way of thinking, enlightenment. It seemed like a lot of the same words repeating, but nonetheless it was still interesting and an easy read. If you're looking for ways to stop overthinking or are getting into looking for zen, and peacefulness in your mind, this is a good book for you."" --Haley Jean (Amazon Reader)",5.0,"""I truly felt like a weight was lifted off of my shoulders after reading this book. Simple and straightforward. To think life could be so simple. Just let go of your thinking and enjoy the present moment. I would recommend this to anyone who suffers from overthinking."" --Nefertima (Amazon Reader)",5.0,"""I love that this author used easy to understand language to explain how our thoughts cause all of our problems! He did a great job using examples and providing steps to help you get on the journey to having a peaceful mind."" --Kindle Customer",5.0,"""The book is full of valuable information, and the author's enthusiasm to share a path to greater happiness with his readers is clear. I've been trying the practice for three days now, and so far it works. I think I will take a few minutes each morning to go outside and just look/listen...no thinking! A quiet contentment arises when I just allow a ""first thought"" to hang there without commenting. Works with hard emotions too, if you have the guts to resist trying to talk yourself out of them.

The writing isn't elegant, but that's beside the point. Also, the parts about the Universe might be a bit much for someone who hasn't yet investigated reality beyond materialism, but I found it to be enlightening. Thank you Joseph"" --""lparks0111"" (Amazon Reader)",4.0,"""This is likely most suited to people who are more analytically-minded. For those on the more creative, artistic side - much of the book is nothing new. I can see that for some, it would be valuable - but for me it wasn't ""speaking my language""."" --D.

Lots of great tips and exercises to help you move forward from past behaviors that you want to shed."" --trefault (Amazon Reader)",5.0,"""I've read quite a few books of this genre, but this is the first one I've found that explains how our emotions, once necessary for survival, can work against us, and how to reset thought patterns that are no longer in our best interest. There are numerous exercises, and many of them have examples, making it easy to get started. The book is comprehensive, but I'd love to meet the author and pick his brain even further."" --Kathryn Brooks (Amazon Reader)",5.0,"""I really enjoyed this book and the lessons. I like that it gave us time frames to focus on the lesson, encouraging us to take our time and not rush through them. I also likes the examples as it helped push my thoughts into gear and to think of more things than I may have on my own. The quotes at the beginning of the chapters were excellent. I saved many of them.
My only negative is some of the content was a little redundant in the chapters. It felt like a few sentences were just reworded to add length."" --William (Amazon Reader)",4.0,"""This is the second or third book that I read from this author and I found it quite forgettable, just as his other ones. The information is always a personal view and conclusions from the author rather than a researched and backed analysis of the subject being presented. Every piece of advice or information can be derived from common sense with very little insight or novelty for someone with a slightly over average skill for overcoming negative situations. I can't imagine what kind of individual would benefit from this book other than the author himself. I don't recommend this nor other books by this author."" --Ignacio Zamora (Amazon Reader)",3.0
